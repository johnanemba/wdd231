            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/content.jpg" alt="John Anemba in the temple" />
            <p>My name is John Anemba, and I am a return missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I come from a family of eight, and I am the sixth child. I am currently living in Nairobi, Kenya. I am a student at Brigham Young University, studying Computer Science. I am still looking for an eternal companion.</p>

            <h2>My Country: Kenya</h2>
            <img src="images/flag.jpg" alt="Kenya flag" />
            <p>Kenya is my homeland, and I am proud of its rich culture and natural beauty. It is home to the famous "Big Five" animals and has some of the best game parks in the world. The country is known for its athletic talent, especially in long-distance running, and has earned the title of "Home of the Champions." Kenyaâ€™s main income comes from tourism, and the population of approximately 40 million people is made up of 44 different ethnic groups. Our staple foods are Ugali and Chapati, and we are known for our warm hospitality and vibrant culture.</p>
